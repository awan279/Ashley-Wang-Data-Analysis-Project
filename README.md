# Ashley-Wang-Data-Analysis-Project
Welcome to our repository for our research project about income inequality in the United States.
Upon conducting an extensive literature review, we formulated our central research question: 
What are some potential factors driving regional disparities in education in the United States, and how do these factors simultaneously affect income disparities?
We approached this project with a couple goals in mind. First, we identified key variables we wanted to investigate in terms of their relationship with income level by state. 
Second, we created visualizations with scatterplots that displayed the correlational strength of two variables. Last, we ran regressions to obtain the r-value, 
along with its p-value, to draw conclusions about the associations and their respective statistical significance. Please explore our repository to look at our coding process, 
as well as the datasets we used for this project.
